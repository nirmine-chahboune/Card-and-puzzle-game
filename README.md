# Card-and-puzzle-game

This project is a mobile application developed using **Android Studio** that includes two mini-games: a **card game** and a **puzzle game**. The app was built entirely by me as part of a personal Android development project.

## 🧩 Puzzle Game

- The user can choose an image from:
  - Suggested images
  - Their **gallery**
  - Or capture one with the **camera**
- The image is then split into pieces and turned into a puzzle

- If successful, a win message appears; otherwise, a retry message is shown
